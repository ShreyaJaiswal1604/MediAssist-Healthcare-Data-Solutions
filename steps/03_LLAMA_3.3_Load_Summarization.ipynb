      "\n",
      "- Procedures: The patient was seen by orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, and trauma surgery teams. Orthopedic surgery recommended non-operative management for the knee fracture, and neurosurgery recommended follow-up in the concussion clinic if needed. A physical therapist recommended disposition home with physical therapy services.\n",

      "- Medical History: The patient has a complex medical history including cirrhosis (likely due to methotrexate treatment for rheumatoid arthritis), varices, pulmonary embolism, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, squamous cell carcinoma, transient monocular visual loss, multinodular goiter, nephrolithiasis, iron deficiency anemia, obstructive sleep apnea, anxiety, and history of multiple episodes of pneumonia.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Symptoms: The patient presents with incidental finding of low hemoglobin, reports feeling lightheaded, dizzy, and weak, but denies symptoms like blood in stools, black stools, emesis, fever, chest pain, palpitations, changes in breathing, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, hematuria, and dysuria.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Findings: Laboratory findings indicate low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, with evidence of anemia. The EGD showed grade I varices in the distal esophagus without active bleeding, and mild portal hypertensive gastropathy. The patient also has a history of C1-C2 fracture and right knee fracture due to a fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Medications: The patient is on multiple medications including albuterol, atorvastatin, mirtazapine, nadolol, acetaminophen, aspirin, abatacept, ferrous sulfate, calcium carbonate, vitamin D, and others. Upon discharge, the medication list was adjusted, including the addition of thiamine for 5 days and changes in dosing for some medications.\n",

      "\n",
      "- Follow-Up Recommendations: The patient needs to follow up with her pulmonologist, have her CBC checked in 2 weeks, and consider chronic macrolide therapy. There is also a recommendation to reevaluate the indication for aspirin, given her history of GI bleed. Additionally, the patient and her family need to revisit and possibly revise her code status and MOLST in the future.\n",

      "- Symptoms: The patient presented with abdominal pain and vomiting after a mechanical fall with head strike. She also reported having \"red urine\" on the day prior to discharge.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Findings: Laboratory results showed a low hematocrit (Hct) level of 20.9, an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) of 4, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies, including a CT scan and an upper endoscopy (EGD), revealed a splenic laceration, hepatic cirrhosis, and varices. A right-upper quadrant (RUQ) ultrasound demonstrated coarsened hepatic echotexture, massive splenomegaly, and large-volume ascites.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Medications: The patient was taking warfarin, celecoxib, fluoxetine, folic acid, calcium, and ferrous sulfate upon admission. At discharge, her medications included celecoxib, fluoxetine, warfarin, calcium carbonate, furosemide, nadolol, spironolactone, and folic acid.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Procedures: The patient underwent an upper endoscopy (EGD) for screening of varices, which revealed grade I varices. She also received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and vitamin K for her splenic laceration.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Diagnosis: The primary diagnosis was cirrhosis and splenic laceration, with secondary diagnoses of rheumatoid arthritis and a hypercoagulable disorder.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Follow-Up Recommendations: The patient was advised to follow up with her doctor to have her INR checked, restart her Coumadin at her home dose, and avoid taking methotrexate in the future. She was also prescribed nadolol, furosemide, and spironolactone to manage her varices, edema, and ascites, and was recommended to have her chemistries checked at her next appointment. Additionally, she requires hepatitis B vaccination and should consider further work-up to determine the nature of her hypercoagulable disorder.\n",
