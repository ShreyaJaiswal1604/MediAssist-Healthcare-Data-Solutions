## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/ShreyaJaiswal1604/MediAssist-Healthcare-Data-Solutions/blob/main/images/Final-architecture%20-image.jpeg)  
**"MediAssist Healthcare Data Workflow: From Raw Ingestion to Clinician Insights"**

### Workflow:
1. **Raw Data Ingestion**: MIMIC-IV data is loaded into the Snowflake **raw layer**.
2. **Data Transformation**: DBT processes and transforms raw data into a **staging layer**.
3. **Dimension Modeling**:
   - ICD-10 codes are generated via:
     1. Hugging Face serverless token.
     2. Vertex AI model deployment.
   - Clinical note summarization and risk stratification results are loaded into the dimension model.
4. **Fact and Dimension Layers**: Finalized data is stored in **facts and dimensions** for analysis.
5. **UI Layer**: A Streamlit-based application provides clinicians real-time access to patient insights.
